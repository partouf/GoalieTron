A WordPress block plugin for displaying Patreon goals and pledge progress.

== Description ==

GoalieTron is a modern WordPress block plugin that enables you to display your Patreon goals and current pledge progress anywhere on your site using the WordPress block editor.

**Version 2.0:** GoalieTron is now exclusively a block plugin, fully embracing the modern WordPress editing experience. Simply add the GoalieTron block to any page, post, or widget area to display your Patreon goals.

You can select from a fixed set of colors and styles to best fit your wordpress theme, with or without the active goal's description.

The plugin does not require a special API key for your Patreon account, it only uses the public part of the Patreon API.

Note: the plugin adds a delay of 1 minute (max) until new pledges will be added up to your progressbar.

== Installation ==

Upload the zip file on the plugin page of your WordPress and activate the plugin.

**Using the Widget:**
The plugin includes a Widget that you can place on your sidebars. You can configure the settings on the Widget.

**Using the Block (WordPress 5.0+):**
1. In the WordPress editor, click the "+" button to add a new block
2. Search for "GoalieTron" in the block inserter
3. Add the GoalieTron block to your page or post
4. Configure the settings in the block inspector panel on the right

The important part of the configuration is your Patreon user id. You can enter your Patreon user name in this field and the plugin will try to look up your user id when you hit Save.
