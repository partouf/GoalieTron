=== Patreonic ===

A plugin for creators that have a page on Patreon.

It makes use of a public API from Patreon to retreive information about the current pledges and active goal.


=== Installing from GitHub ===

To install the plugin from GitHub, there's a couple things you unfortunately need to do before uploading it to your Wordpress installation:
* Download the code as a zip (the clone button will give you that option)
* Extract the zip file to a folder of your liking
* Rename the folder that's in the folder you just extracted from "Patreonic-master" to "patreonic"
* Zip the patreonic folder
* Upload the new zip to Wordpress
