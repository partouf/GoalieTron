A WordPress block plugin for displaying Patreon goals and pledge progress.

== Description ==

GoalieTron is a modern WordPress block plugin that enables you to display your Patreon goals and current pledge progress anywhere on your site using the WordPress block editor.

**Version 2.0:** GoalieTron is now exclusively a block plugin, fully embracing the modern WordPress editing experience. Simply add the GoalieTron block to any page, post, or widget area to display your Patreon goals.

You can select from a fixed set of colors and styles to best fit your wordpress theme, with or without the active goal's description.

The plugin does not require a special API key for your Patreon account, it only uses the public part of the Patreon API.

Note: the plugin adds a delay of 1 minute (max) until new pledges will be added up to your progressbar.
