A pledge goal widget for creators that have a Patreon page.

== Description ==

This plugin enables you to place a widget on your sidebar to show your current goal and pledge amount on Patreon.

You can select from a fixed set of colors and styles to best fit your wordpress theme, with or without the active goal's description.

The plugin does not require a special API key for your Patreon account, it only uses the public part of the Patreon API.

Note: the plugin adds a delay of 1 minute (max) until new pledges will be added up to your progressbar.

== Installation ==

Upload the zip file on the plugin page of your Wordpress and activate the plugin.

The plugin is installed as a Widget that you can place on your sidebars. You can configure the settings on the Widget.

The important part of the configuration is your Patreon user id. You can enter your Patreon user name in this field and the plugin will try to look up your user id when you hit Save.
